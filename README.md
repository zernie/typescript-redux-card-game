## Project structure
* `src/models` contains game models' type declarations and some helper functions.
* `src/redux` contains contains actual game logic, using Redux and decoupled from UI rendering. 
   It is highly recommended to use [redux-devtools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools) for debugging.
* `src/UI` is a React implementation of Game UI.
