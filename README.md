# React & Redux based Hearthstone clone
Built for educational purposes only. Your contributions are welcome ðŸ˜‰

### [PLAY DEMO](https://zernie.com/typescript-redux-card-game/)

## Project structure
* `src/models` contains game models' type declarations and some helper functions.
* `src/redux` contains the actual game logic, decoupled from the UI rendering. It uses **Redux** state library.
   It is highly recommended to use [redux-devtools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools) Chrome extension for debugging.
* `src/UI` is a **React**-based implementation of Game's UI.

## Development
    $ yarn && yarn start

Now open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser :tada:
